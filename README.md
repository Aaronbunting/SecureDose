# SecureDose: Combatting Counterfeit Drugs with Blockchain

# Description
PharmaChain aims to combat the pressing concern of counterfeit drugs, especially prevalent in regions like North India, using the transparency and immutability features of blockchain. This project seeks to establish a tamper-proof, transparent, and efficient mechanism to track and verify medications throughout their supply chain, offering consumers a reliable method to ensure the authenticity of their purchases.

# Problem Statement
In developing countries, the pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges due to a lack of transparency and accountability in its supply chain. This opacity has led to the widespread proliferation of counterfeit drugs, presenting grave health risks to consumers and causing substantial financial losses.
